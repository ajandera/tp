	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent
   or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder.
   The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through
   an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture,
   the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with
   recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine
   translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while
   being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to
   train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German
   translation task, improving over the existing best results, including
   ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation
   task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU
   score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small
   fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

	abstract = {We present an all-optical neuron that utilizes a logistic sigmoid
   activation function, using a Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM)
   input \& weighting scheme. The activation function is realized by means
   of a deeply-saturated differentially-biased Semiconductor Optical
   Amplifier-Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (SOA-MZI) followed by a
   SOA-Cross-Gain-Modulation (XGM) gate. Its transfer function is both
   experimentally and theoretically analyzed, showing excellent agreement
   between theory and experiment and an almost perfect fitting with a
   logistic sigmoid function. The optical sigmoid transfer function is then
   exploited in the experimental demonstration of a photonic neuron,
   demonstrating successful thresholding over a 100psec-long pulse sequence
   with 4 different weighted-and-summed power levels. (C) 2019 Optical

@article{WOS:000516613400014,
	abstract = {Neuromorphic photonics aims to transfer the high-bandwidth and
   low-energy credentials of optics into neuromorphic computing
   architectures. In this effort, photonic neurons are trying to combine
   the optical interconnect segments with optics that can realize all
   critical constituent neuromorphic functions, including the linear neuron
   stage and the activation function. However, aligning this new platform
   with well-established neural network training models in order to allow
   for the synergy of the photonic hardware with the best-in-class training
   algorithms, the following requirements should apply: i) the linear
   photonic neuron has to be able to handle both positive and negative
   weight values, ii) the activation function has to closely follow the
   widely used mathematical activation functions that have already shown an
   enormous performance in demonstrated neural networks so far. Herein, we
   demonstrate a coherent linear neuron architecture that relies on a
   dual-IQ modulation cell as its basic neuron element, introducing
   distinct optical elements for weight amplitude and weight sign
   representation and exploiting binary optical carrier phase-encoding for
   positive/negative number representation. We present experimental results
   of a typical IQ modulator performing as an elementary two-input linear
   neuron cell and successfully implementing all-optical linear algebraic
   operations with 104-ps long optical pulses. We also provide the
   theoretical proof and formulation of how to extend a dual-IQ modulation
   cell into a complete \$N\$-input coherent linear neuron stage that
   requires only a single-wavelength optical input and avoids the
   resource-consuming Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) weighting
   schemes. An 8-input coherent linear neuron is then combined with an
   experimentally validated optical sigmoid activation function into a
   physical layer simulation environment, with respective training and
   physical layer simulation results for the MNIST dataset revealing an
   average accuracy of 97.24\% and 94.37\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {The task of estimating the fundamental frequency of a monophonic sound
   recording, also known as pitch tracking, is fundamental to audio
   processing with multiple applications in speech processing and music
   information retrieval. To date, the best performing techniques, such as
   the pYIN algorithm, are based on a combination of DSP pipelines and
   heuristics. While such techniques perform very well on average, there
   remain many cases in which they fail to correctly estimate the pitch. In
   this paper, we propose a data-driven pitch tracking algorithm, CREPE,
   which is based on a deep convolutional neural network that operates
   directly on the time-domain waveform. We show that the proposed model
   produces state-of-the-art results, performing equally or better than
   pYIN. Furthermore, we evaluate the model's generalizability in terms of
   noise robustness. A pre-trained version of CREPE is made freely
   available as an open-source Python module for easy application.},

	abstract = {Fundamental frequency (f(0)) estimation, also known as pitch tracking,
   has been a long-standing research topic in the speech and signal
   processing community. Many pitch estimation algorithms, however, fail in
   noisy conditions or introduce large delays due to their frame size or
   Viterbi decoding.
   In this study, we propose a deep learning-based pitch estimation
   algorithm, LACOPE, which was trained in a joint pitch estimation and
   speech enhancement framework. In contrast to previous work, this
   algorithm allows for a configurable latency down to an algorithmic delay
   of 0. This is achieved by exploiting the smoothness properties of the
   pitch trajectory. That is, a recurrent neural network compensates delay
   introduced by the feature computation by predicting the pitch for a
   desired point, allowing a trade-off between pitch accuracy and latency.
   We integrate the pitch estimation in a speech enhancement framework for
   hearing aids. For this application, we allow a delay on the analysis
   side of approx. 5ms. The pitch estimate is then used for constructing a
   comb filter in frequency domain as post-processing step to remove
   intra-harmonic noise.
   Our pitch estimation performance is on par with SOTA algorithms like
   PYIN or CREPE for spoken speech in all noise conditions while
   introducing minimal latency.},

	abstract = {Forecasting has always been at the forefront of decision making and
   planning. The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and
   challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise
   risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting
   applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle
   real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of
   the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a
   wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles,
   and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We
   then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety
   of real-life contexts.
   We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and
   applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will
   offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken
   over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of
   forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the
   intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to
   allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement
   the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free
   or open-source software implementations and publicly-available
   databases. (C) 2021 The Author( s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

According to the criterion of the inflection point in this paper, the path inflection point arrays are constructed and traveling all path nodes are replaced by traveling path inflection points for the conventional Floyd algorithm backtracking, so it greatly reduces the backtracking time of the smooth path. In addition, this paper adopts the method of the extended grid map obstacle space in path planning safety distance. According to the relationship between the actual scale of the warehouse grid map and the size of the robot body, the different safe distance between the planning path and the obstacles is obtained, so that the algorithm can be applied to the safe path planning of the different size robots in any map environments. Finally, compared with the conventional A<svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="vertical-align:-0.04980993pt" id="M5" height="6.01072pt" version="1.1" viewBox="-0.0498162 -5.96091 7.75925 6.01072" width="7.75925pt"><g transform="matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)"><use xlink:href="{\#}g113-43"/></g></svg> algorithm, the improved algorithm reduces by 7.846{\%} for the path length, reduces by 71.429{\%} for the number of the cumulative turns, and reduces by 75{\%} for the cumulative turning angle through the experiment. The proposed method can ensure robots to move fast on the planning path and ultimately achieve the goal of reducing the number of inflection points, reducing the cumulative turning angle, and reducing the path planning time.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an intensive discussion for the dynamical model of the love triangle in both integer and fractional-order domains. Three different types of nonlinearities soft, hard, and mixed between soft and hard, are used in this study. MATLAB numerical simulations for the different three categories are presented. Also, a discussion for how the kind of personalities affects the behavior of chaotic attractors is introduced. This paper suggests some explanations for the complex love relationships depending on the impact of memory (IoM) principle. Lyapunov exponents, Kaplan-Yorke dimension, and bifurcation diagrams for three different integer-order cases show a significant dependency on system parameters. Hardware digital realization of the system is done using the Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A100T FPGA kit. Version 14.7 from the Xilinx ISE platform is used in both Verilog simulation and hardware implementation stages. The digital approach of such a system opens the door to predict the love relation after sensing the human personality. Also, this study will help in justifying more human emotions like happiness, panic, and fear accurately. Perhaps shortly, this study may combine with artificial intelligence to demonstrate Human-Computer interaction products.},

   applications. However, pitch determination in noisy conditions is
   difficult. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning algorithm to
   estimate pitch using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically,
   we use a CNN for pitch candidate selection, and dynamic programming for
   pitch tracking. Our experimental results show that the proposed method
   can obtain accurate pitch estimation and they show good generalization
   ability to new speakers and noisy conditions. We credit the success to
   the use of CNN, which is suitable for modeling the shift-invariant
   spectral feature for pitch detection.},

	abstract = {The article presents the results of applying a genetic algorithm to find the most optimal architecture of the neural network that would solve classification problem with minimal errors. The stages of the genetic algorithm are considered and the rule for encoding the parameters of the neural network is determined. A genetic algorithm for constructing the optimal architecture of a multilayer perceptron for solving classification problems has been developed. The algorithm independently creates a random population, evolves, creating new generations with more adapted individuals, i.e., neural networks with better architectures than previous generations. The paper describes the process of population formation, substantiates the choice of the fitness function and the method of selecting parents. Modifications of the crossover and mutation operators are proposed in order to ensure the operability of the algorithm on variable size individuals. A software tool that generates a neural network with the best parameters for solving classification problems has been developed on Python3 programming language. The architecture of a neural network for detecting fraudulent transactions has been built by using the developed software.},

	abstract = {Recent work on deep neural networks as acoustic models for automatic
   speech recognition (ASR) have demonstrated substantial performance
   improvements. We introduce a model which uses a deep recurrent auto
   encoder neural network to denoise input features for robust ASR. The
   model is trained on stereo (noisy and clean) audio features to predict
   clean features given noisy input. The model makes no assumptions about
   how noise affects the signal, nor the existence of distinct noise
   environments. Instead, the model can learn to model any type of
   distortion or additive noise given sufficient training data. We
   demonstrate the model is competitive with existing feature denoising
   approaches on the Aurora2 task, and outperforms a tandem approach where
   deep networks are used to predict phoneme posteriors directly.},

	abstract = {In low bit-rate coders, the near-sample and far-sample redundancies of
   the speech signal are usually removed by a cascade of a short-term and a
   long-term linear predictor. These two predictors are usually found in a
   sequential and therefore suboptimal approach. In this paper we propose
   an analysis model that jointly finds the two predictors by adding a
   regularization term in the minimization process to impose sparsity
   constraints on a high order predictor. The result is a linear predictor
   that can be easily factorized into the short-term and long-term
   predictors. This estimation method is then incorporated into an
   Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction scheme and shows to have a
   better performance than traditional cascade methods and other joint
   optimization methods, offering lower distortion and higher perceptual
   speech quality.},

   extract the BCG sources. The main reason of using this technique is to
   jointly model the temporal structure (short-term prediction) of sources
   and exploiting the prior information of BCG sources (long-term
   prediction). The results of extensive experiments on both synthetic and
   real data confirm the strength of the proposed technique to effectively
   remove the BCG artifact.},

	abstract = {Weighted linear prediction (WLP) is a method to compute all-pole models
   of speech by applying temporal weighting of the square of the residual
   signal. By using short-time energy (STE) as a weighting function, this
   algorithm was originally proposed as an improved linear predictive (LP)
   method based oil emphasising those samples that fit the underlying
   speech production model well. The original formulation of WLP, however,
   did not guarantee stability of all-pole models. Therefore, the current
   work revisits the concept of WLP by introducing a modified short-time
   energy function leading always to stable all-pole models. This new
   method, stabilised weighted linear prediction (SWLP), is shown to yield
   all-pole models whose general performance can be adjusted by properly
   choosing the length of the STE window, a parameter denoted by M.
   The study compares the performances of SWLP, minimum variance
   distortionless response (MVDR), and conventional LP in spectral
   modelling of speech corrupted by additive noise. The comparisons were
   performed by computing, for each method, the logarithmic spectral
   differences between the all-pole spectra extracted from clean and noisy
   speech in different segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) categories.
   The results showed that the proposed SWLP algorithm was the most robust
   method against zero-mean Gaussian noise and the robustness was largest
   for SWLP with a small M-value. These findings were corroborated by a
   small listening test in which the majority of the listeners assessed the
   quality of impulse-train-excited SWLP filters, extracted from noisy
   speech, to be perceptually closer to original clean speech than the
   corresponding all-pole responses computed by MVDR. Finally, SWLP was
   compared to other short-time spectral estimation methods (FFT, LP, MVDR)
   in isolated word recognition experiments. Recognition accuracy obtained
   by SWLP, in comparison to other short-time spectral estimation methods,
   improved already at moderate segmental SNR values for sounds corrupted
   by zero-mean Gaussian noise. For realistic factory noise of low pass
   characteristics, the SWLP method improved file recognition results at
   segmental SNR levels below 0 dB. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   narrowband source localization problem, which does not require

   based on the second-order statistics (SOS) of the outputs of a uniform
   linear array (ULA). More precisely, the range and angle parameters are
   estimated through a weighted linear prediction (LP) algorithm applied to
   a properly chosen array output correlation sequence. Detailed
   performance analysis and derivation of the optimal weightings are
   provided. Simulation results are finally presented to validate the
   theoretical analysis results and to assess the performance of the

	abstract = {Following earlier work, we modify linear predictive (LP) speech analysis
   by including temporal weighting of the squared prediction error in the
   model optimization. In order to focus this so called weighted LP model
   on the least noisy signal regions in the presence of stationary additive
   noise, we use short-time signal energy as the weighting function. We
   compare the noisy spectrum analysis performance of weighted LP and its
   recently proposed variant, the latter guaranteed to produce stable
   synthesis models. As a practical test case, we use automatic speech
   recognition to verify that the weighted LP methods improve upon the
   conventional FFT and LP methods by making spectrum estimates less prone
   to corruption by additive noise.},

   (LP), including both conventional and temporally weighted LP analysis
   methods as special cases. The temporally weighted methods have recently
   been successfully applied to noise robust spectrum analysis in speech
   and speaker recognition applications. In comparison to those earlier
   methods, the new generalized approach allows more versatility in
   weighting different parts of the data in the LP analysis. Two such
   weighted methods are evaluated and compared to the conventional spectrum
   modeling methods FFT and LP, as well as the temporally weighted methods
   WLP and SWLP, by substituting each of them in turn as the spectrum
   estimation method of the MFCC feature extraction stage of a GMM-UBM
   based speaker verification system. The new methods are shown to lead to
   performance improvement in several cases involving channel distortion
   and additive noise mismatch between the training and recognition
   conditions.},

	abstract = {Unconventional events exacerbate the imbalance between regional
   transportation demand and limited road network resources. Scientific and
   efficient path planning serves as the foundation for rapidly restoring
   equilibrium to the road network. In real large-scale road networks,
   especially during emergencies, it is usually difficult to obtain or
   predict accurate dynamic traffic network flows in real-time, which is
   used to support equilibrium path planning. Moreover, the traditional
   iterative methods cannot meet the real-time demand of emergency
   equilibrium path planning decision generation. To solve the above
   problems, this paper proposes a hybrid control architecture for path
   planning based on equilibrium traffic assignment theory. The
   architecture introduces the travelers' real-time travel data and
   constructs a spatio-temporal neural network, which captures the
   evolution of traffic network loads. Adaptive multi-graph fusion
   technology is used to mix the background traffic flow data and the
   traveler's real-time Origin-Destination (OD) data, to mine the dynamic

	abstract = {Solving multiobjective optimization problems means finding the best
   balance among multiple conflicting objectives. This needs preference
   information from a decision maker who is a domain expert. In interactive
   methods, the decision maker takes part in an iterative process to learn
   about the interdependencies and can adjust the preferences. We address
   the need to compare different interactive multiobjective optimization
   methods, which is essential when selecting the most suited method for
   solving a particular problem. We concentrate on a class of interactive
   methods where a decision maker expresses preference information as
   reference points, i.e., desirable objective function values. Comparison
   of interactive methods with human decision makers is not a
   straightforward process due to cost and reliability issues. The lack of
   suitable behavioral models hampers creating artificial decision makers
   for automatic experiments. Few approaches to automating testing have
   been proposed in the literature; however, none are widely used. As a
   result, empirical performance studies are scarce for this class of
   methods despite its popularity among researchers and practitioners. We
   have developed a new approach to replace a decision maker to
   automatically compare interactive methods based on reference points or
   similar preference information. Keeping in mind the lack of suitable
   human behavioral models, we concentrate on evaluating general
   performance characteristics. Such an evaluation can partly address the
   absence of any tests and is appropriate for screening methods before
   more rigorous testing. We have implemented our approach as a
   ready-to-use Python module and illustrated it with computational
   examples.},

   it is expected that, sooner or later, all organizations have to deal
   with cyberattacks; hence organizations need to be more cyber resilient.
   This paper presents a novel framework of cyber resilience, integrating
   models from resilience engineering and human behavior. Based on a pilot
   study with nearly 60 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the
   Netherlands, this paper shows that the proposed framework holds the
   promise for better development of human aspects of cyber resilience
   within organizations. The framework provides organizations with
   diagnostic capability into how to better prepare for emerging cyber
   threats, while assuring the viability of human aspects of cyber security
   critical to their business continuity. Moreover, knowing the sources of
   behavior that predict cyber resiliency may help in the development of
   successful behavioral intervention programs.},

	abstract = {The operation of today's robots entails interactions with humans, e.g.,
   in autonomous driving amidst human-driven vehicles. To effectively do
   so, robots must proactively decode the intent of humans and concurrently
   leverage this knowledge for safe, cooperative task satisfaction: a
   problem we refer to as proactive decision making. However, simultaneous
   intent decoding and robotic control requires reasoning over several
   possible human behavioral models, resulting in high-dimensional state
   trajectories. In this paper, we address the proactive decision-making
   problem using a novel combination of formal methods, control, and data
   mining techniques. First, we distill high-dimensional state trajectories
   of human-robot interaction into concise, symbolic behavioral summaries
   that can be learned from data. Second, we leverage formal methods to
   model high-level agent goals, safe interaction, and information-seeking
   behavior with temporal logic formulas. Finally, we design a novel
   decision-making scheme that maintains a belief distribution over models
   of human behavior, and proactively plans informative actions. After
   showing several desirable theoretical properties, we apply our framework
   to a dataset of humans driving in crowded merging scenarios. For it,
   temporal logic models are generated and used to synthesize control
   strategies using tree-based value iteration and deep reinforcement
   learning. In addition, we illustrate how data-driven models of human
   responses to informative robot probes, such as from generative models
   such as conditional variational autoencoders, can be clustered with
   formal specifications. Results from simulated self-driving car scenarios
   demonstrate that data-driven strategies enable safe interaction, correct
   model identification, and significant dimensionality reduction.},

	abstract = {Earlier research provides inconsistent evidence for effects of
   pedagogical agents on learning outcomes. We claim that the agent's
   instructional method helps to explain the inconsistency, with agents
   that offer behavioral modeling as an instructional method leading to
   better learning. We conducted two studies to investigate effects of the
   use of an artificial agent as a persuasive behavioral model on
   individuals' learning outcomes in the context of computer training.
   Specifically, in both studies, participants watched an instructional
   video on how to perform a web search with their eyes using a novel
   eye-tracking software. Study 1 examined the effects of agent-delivered
   modeling vs. two non-modeling instructional methods (agent-delivered
   instructional narration and no agent, text-only instruction) on
   participants' (N = 197) self-efficacy and system-specific perceptions of
   ease of use. Study 2 extends findings of Study 1 by examining effects of
   agent-delivered modeling vs. two non-modeling instructional methods
   (agent-delivered instructional narration and no agent, voice-only
   instructional narration) on participants' (N = 99) declarative knowledge
   and task performance. Previous work with human behavioral models showed
   an advantage of behavioral modeling over other non-modeling
   instructional methods in influencing learning outcomes. Therefore,
   agent-delivered modeling was predicted to be more effective in
   influencing motivational (i.e., self-efficacy) and learning outcomes
   (i.e., declarative knowledge, task performance). In accordance with our
   hypotheses, results revealed that participants who received instructions
   from an artificial agent as a behavioral model reported significantly
   stronger self-efficacy beliefs, tended to have higher system-specific
   ease of use, exhibited enhanced declarative knowledge, and better task
   performance skills.},

   optimizing the energy consumption in the smart grid. Considering the
   critical yet complex human behavior issue, we develop new population
   dynamic models to describe the behavior of DSM users and use them to
   analyze the performance of DSM. We first introduce an accurate Markov
   model for the DSM population. We show that this model can be converted
   into a form similar to the popular SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)
   model in mathematical biology. Then, we formulate a composite model that
   integrates the new DSM user behavioral model with a game theoretic DSM
   scheme. The convergence and the equilibrium of the composite model are
   studied both analytically and numerically. Experiments are conducted to
   determine the important model parameters.},

   One is a fixed point theorem for parametric dynamic systems in
   quasimetric spaces, which can also be interpreted as an existence
   theorem of minimal points with respect to reflexive and transitive
   preferences for sets in products spaces. The other one is a variational
   principle for set-valued mappings acting from quasimetric spaces to
   vector spaces with variable ordering structures, which can be treated as
   a far-going extension of Ekeland's variational principle to this
   setting. Both of these results are motivated by applications to adaptive
   dynamical aspects of Sen's capability theory of wellbeing. As
   consequence of our mathematical results, we develop new applications to
   such human behavioral models by using a recent variational rationality
   approach to behavioral sciences.},

	abstract = {Existing models of coastal occupation, in one form or another, embrace
   the assumption that changes in mean sea level were the prime driver for
   shifts in coastal resource productivity of consequence to coastal
   foragers. Focusing on the North West Shelf of Australia, this paper
   considers the role of physical sedimentary processes in understanding
   both past coastal resource productivity and the archaeology of drowned
   coastal landscapes. From a review of up-to-date literature on sea-level
   related coastal formation process related to the North West Shelf, we
   describe the complex interplay of sea-level change and sedimentary
   processes in determining (i) coastal resource availability, and (ii)
   archaeological site preservation potential through time. We argue that
   human behavioral models that have been linked solely to changes in sea
   level change from ca. 45 ka onward along the Australia continental shelf
   have inadequately accounted for local sedimentary regimes. It is not
   past sea-level perse, which is of relevance to coastal productivity and
   human behavioral ecology models but changes in tidal regimes, coastal
   configurations and sedimentation. We conclude that our understanding of
   maritime adaptations for Sahul (Greater Australia) remain incomplete
   without investigating former coastlines and archaeological information
   that now lies submerged offshore. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {An agent-based profiling approach is presented in this paper in the form
   of a virtual interface that models user behavior and satisfaction with
   the objective of improving the performance of high-performance computing
   (HPC) centers. The interface's function is to translate user requests
   and satisfaction criteria into what is really necessary, thus permitting
   the optimization of the HPC center's scheduling, taking into account the
   predicted user satisfaction together with the objectives of the
   management of the center in terms of resource usage and cost. The system
   is built using an evolutionary agent-based profiling architecture where
   agents are evolved in real time to adapt to the different users. These
   agents cooperate with the scheduling mechanism, providing resource usage
   estimations for the different tasks, as well as predicting the effect of
   possible strategies on user satisfaction. This paper focuses on the user
   behavior modeling component, although the global architecture is also
   presented. Some experiments are carried out where the proposed
   architecture interacts with a real job-management system QMS (Sun Grid
   Engine). They clearly show that modeling the user and taking user
   satisfaction into account helps to improve system performance.},

   though. poses problems given the great demands on skilled practitioners'

   various sources of stress in order to observe the response of each model

   preliminary effort in adopting this approach using Team Interaction
   Analysis with Reusable Agents (TIARA), an implementation platform for
   modeling interactive behaviors and human decision processes in stressful
   conditions. The current instantiation of TIARA models mission crew
   positions within the E2-C airborne early warning aircraft and allows for
   variable proficiency levels in one crew member. We describe our

	abstract = {With the growth of Information Technology in all aspects of management,
   business and entertainment, there is an increasing demand for networking
   for very varied purposes: fast file transfer, video streaming and Voice
   over Internet Protocol. Configurability, adaptability, intelligence and
   QoS orientation are the qualities of a successful future transport
   protocol. A constant process of analyzing networking through fitness
   level, allows feedback on QoS achievement and subsequent protocol
   engineering. In this paper, we present an intelligent protocol, Genetic
   Algorithm Transport Protocol (GATP) based on genetic algorithm that can
   evolve and adapt to the network environment and achieve an evolving
   user-configurable QoS. Using a constant process of negotiation,
   implementation and feedback, a QoS-focused networking between peers will
   be achieved. A review of experimental results will provide an
   interesting insight into genetic algorithm behavior in an actual network
   environment.},

	abstract = {Genetic algorithm behavior is determined by the exploration/exploitation
   balance kept throughout the run. When this balance is
   disproportionate,;the premature convergence problem will probably
   appear, causing a drop in the genetic-algorithm's efficacy. One approach
   presented for dealing with this problem is the distributed genetic
   algorithm model. Its basic idea is to keep, in parallel, several
   subpopulations that are processed by genetic algorithms, with each one
   being independent from the others Furthermore, a migration operator
   produces a chromosome exchange between the subpopulations. Making
   distinctions between the subpopulations of a distributed: genetic
   algorithm by applying,genetic algorithms with different configurations,
   we obtain the so-called heterogeneous distributed genetic algorithms. In
   this paper, we present a hierarchical model of distributed genetic
   algorithms in which a higher level distributed:genetic algorithm joins
   different simple distributed genetic algorithms. Furthermore, with the
   union of the hierarchical structure presented and the idea of the
   heterogeneous distributed genetic algorithms, we propose a type of
   heterogeneous hierarchical distributed genetic algorithms, the
   hierarchical gradual distributed genetic algorithms. Experimental
   results show that the proposals consistently outperform equivalent
   sequential genetic algorithms and simple distributed genetic algorithms.

	abstract = {This paper studies the behavior of the genetic algorithm in coordination
   games with strategic uncertainty that are characterized by the
   multiplicity of equilibria. The main objectives are to examine whether
   the genetic algorithm adaptation leads to coordination and what the long
   run properties of the dynamics are. The genetic algorithm behavior is
   compared to the evidence from the experiments with human subjects. The
   adaptation of genetic algorithm players results in coordination on an
   equilibrium. Which equilibrium is selected depends on the group size.
   The analysis of the long-run properties of the dynamics show that, as a
   result of the continuing effects of the genetic drift, the genetic
   algorithm can reach any of the equilibria of the game regardless of the
   group size. Simulations with large group treatments spend most of the
   time in Pareto-inferior equilibria, while simulations with small group
   treatments spend most of the time in Pareto-superior equilibria of the
   game.},

	abstract = {Genetic algorithm behavior is described in terms of the construction and
   evolution of the sampling distributions over the space of candidate
   solutions. This novel perspective is motivated by analysis indicating
   that the schema theory is inadequate for completely and properly
   explaining genetic algorithm behavior. Based on the proposed theory, it
   is argued that the similarities of candidate solutions should be
   exploited directly, rather than encoding candidate solutions and then
   exploiting their similarities. Proportional selection is characterized
   as a global search operator, and recombination is characterized as the
   search process that exploits similarities. Sequential algorithms and
   many deletion methods are also analyzed. It is shown that by properly
   constraining the search breadth of recombination operators, convergence
   of genetic algorithms to a global optimum can be ensured.},

	abstract = {Graph neural networks have been shown to be very effective in utilizing
   pairwise relationships across samples. Recently, there have been several
   successful proposals to generalize graph neural networks to hypergraph
   neural networks to exploit more complex relationships. In particular,
   the hypergraph collaborative networks yield superior results compared to
   other hypergraph neural networks for various semi-supervised learning
   tasks. The collaborative network can provide high quality vertex
   embeddings and hyperedge embeddings together by formulating them as a
   joint optimization problem and by using their consistency in
   reconstructing the given hypergraph. In this paper, we aim to establish
   the algorithmic stability of the core layer of the collaborative network
   and provide generalization guarantees. The analysis sheds light on the
   design of hypergraph filters in collaborative networks, for instance,
   how the data and hypergraph filters should be scaled to achieve uniform
   stability of the learning process. Some experimental results on
   real-world datasets are presented to illustrate the theory.},

	abstract = {Atom-centred neural networks represent the state-of-the-art for
   approximating the quantum chemical properties of molecules, such as
   internal energies. While the design of machine learning architectures
   that respect chemical principles has continued to advance, the final
   atom pooling operation that is necessary to convert from atomic to
   molecular representations in most models remains relatively undeveloped.
   The most common choices, sum and average pooling, compute molecular
   representations that are naturally a good fit for many physical
   properties, while satisfying properties such as permutation invariance
   which are desirable from a geometric deep learning perspective. However,
   there are growing concerns that such simplistic functions might have
   limited representational power, while also being suboptimal for physical
   properties that are highly localised or intensive. Based on recent
   advances in graph representation learning, we investigate the use of a
   learnable pooling function that leverages an attention mechanism to
   model interactions between atom representations. The proposed pooling
   operation is a drop-in replacement requiring no changes to any of the
   other architectural components. Using SchNet and DimeNet++ as starting
   models, we demonstrate consistent uplifts in performance compared to sum
   and mean pooling and a recent physics-aware pooling operation designed
   specifically for orbital energies, on several datasets, properties, and
   levels of theory, with up to 85\% improvements depending on the specific
   task.
   Atom-centered neural networks represent the state-of-the-art for

@article{WOS:001091632800001,
	abstract = {The brain, an exceedingly intricate information processing system, poses
   a constant challenge to memory research, particularly in comprehending
   how it encodes, stores, and retrieves information. Cognitive psychology
   studies memory mechanism from behavioral experiment level and fMRI
   level, and neurobiology studies memory mechanism from anatomy and
   electrophysiology level. Current research findings are insufficient to
   provide a comprehensive, detailed explanation of memory processes within
   the brain. Numerous unknown details must be addressed to establish a
   complete information processing mechanism connecting micro molecular
   cellular levels with macro cognitive behavioral levels. Key issues
   include characterizing and distributing content within biological neural
   networks, coexisting information with varying content, and sharing
   limited resources and storage capacity. Compared with the hard disk of
   computer mass storage, it is very clear from the polarity of magnetic
   particles in the bottom layer, the division of tracks and sectors in the
   middle layer, to the directory tree and file management system in the
   high layer, but the understanding of memory is not sufficient.
   Biological neural networks are abstracted as directed graphs, and the
   encoding, storage, and retrieval of information within directed graphs
   at the cellular level are explored. A memory computational model based
   on active directed graphs and node-adaptive learning is proposed. First,
   based on neuronal local perspectives, autonomous initiative, limited
   resource competition, and other neurobiological characteristics, a
   resource-based adaptive learning algorithm for directed graph nodes is
   designed. To minimize resource consumption of memory content in directed
   graphs, two resource-occupancy optimization strategies-lateral
   inhibition and path pruning-are proposed. Second, this paper introduces
   a novel memory mechanism grounded in graph theory, which considers
   connected subgraphs as the physical manifestation of memory content in
   directed graphs. The encoding, storage, consolidation, and retrieval of
   the brain's memory system correspond to specific operations such as
   forming subgraphs, accommodating multiple subgraphs, strengthening
   connections and connectivity of subgraphs, and activating subgraphs.
   Lastly, a series of experiments were designed to simulate cognitive
   processes and evaluate the performance of the directed graph model.
   Experimental results reveal that the proposed adaptive connectivity
   learning algorithm for directed graphs in this paper possesses the
   following four features: (1) Demonstrating distributed, self-organizing,
   and self-adaptive properties, the algorithm achieves global-level
   functions through local node interactions; (2) Enabling incremental
   storage and supporting continuous learning capabilities; (3) Displaying
   stable memory performance, it surpasses the Hopfield network in memory
   accuracy, capacity, and diversity, as demonstrated in experimental
   comparisons. Moreover, it maintains high memory performance with
   large-scale datasets; (4) Exhibiting a degree of generalization ability,
   the algorithm's macroscopic performance remains unaffected by the
   topological structure of the directed graph. Large-scale, decentralized,
   and node-autonomous directed graphs are suitable simulation methods.
   Examining storage problems within directed graphs can reveal the essence
   of phenomena and uncover fundamental storage rules hidden within complex
   neuronal mechanisms, such as synaptic plasticity, ion channels,
   neurotransmitters, and electrochemical activities.},

	abstract = {A classic optimization problem with many real-world applications is
   optimal route search in graphs or networks. Graphical networks
   resembling real world networks are an important requirement for these
   studies. Python packages NetworkX and OSMnx are probably the most
   popular approaches in industry for creating and analyzing real world
   graphical networks using ESRI S hapefiles (Geospatial Vector Data ).
   However, creating such a network is a complex and tedious process as
   these packages require the input data to be in a specific format. In
   this study,center dot We outline a flexible method that can be used to
   easily create graphical network representations in NetworkX or OSMnx
   using road network topology data stored in ESRI Shapefiles .center dot A
   detailed step-by-step process is outlined to successfully transform the
   ESRI Shapefile data into the compatible format for graph analysis
   libraries like OSMnx and NetworkX.center dot A data cleaning strategy is
   suggested to reduce resource consumption without distorting the actual
   structure of the graph. This method will allow researchers to
   efficiently generate graphical networks and validate their theories by
   evaluating their efficiencies using real-world network data of different
   sizes and topologies.This method could benefit, but is not limited to,
   research areas such as Advanced Transportation Systems (ATS), Graph
   Neural Networks (GNN), Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms, to mention a
   few.},

	abstract = {Preterm-born neonates are prone to impaired neurodevelopment that may be
   associated with disrupted whole-brain structural connectivity. The
   present study aimed to investigate the longitudinal developmental
   pattern of the structural network from preterm birth to term-equivalent
   age (TEA), and identify how prematurity influences the network
   topological organization and properties of local brain regions.
   Multi-shell diffusion-weighted MRI of 28 preterm-born scanned a short
   time after birth (PB-AB) and at TEA (PB-TEA), and 28 matched term-born
   (TB) neonates in the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) were
   used to construct structural networks through constrained spherical
   deconvolution tractography. Structural network development from preterm
   birth to TEA showed reduced shortest path length, clustering
   coefficient, and modularity, and more ``connector{''} hubs linking
   disparate communities. Furthermore, compared with TB newborns, premature
   birth significantly altered the nodal properties (i.e., clustering
   coefficient, within-module degree, and participation coefficient) in the
   limbic/paralimbic, default-mode, and subcortical systems but not global
   topology at TEA, and we were able to distinguish the PB from TB neonates
   at TEA based on the nodal properties with 96.43\% accuracy. Our findings
   demonstrated a topological reorganization of the structural network
   occurs during the perinatal period that may prioritize the optimization
   of global network organization to form a more efficient architecture;
   and local topology was more vulnerable to premature birth-related
   factors than global organization of the structural network, which may
   underlie the impaired cognition and behavior in PB infants.},

	abstract = {Early adversity can change educational, cognitive, and mental health
   outcomes. However, the neural processes through which early adversity
   exerts these effects remain largely unknown. We used generative network
   modeling of the mouse connectome to test whether unpredictable postnatal
   stress shifts the constraints that govern the organization of the
   structural connectome. A model that trades off the wiring cost of
   long-distance connections with topological homophily (i.e., links
   between regions with shared neighbors) generated simulations that
   successfully replicate the rodent connectome. The imposition of early
   life adversity shifted the best-performing parameter combinations toward
   zero, heightening the stochastic nature of the generative process. Put
   simply, unpredictable postnatal stress changes the economic constraints
   that reproduce rodent connectome organization, introducing greater
   randomness into the development of the simulations. While this change
   may constrain the development of cognitive abilities, it could also
   reflect an adaptive mechanism that facilitates effective responses to
   future challenges.},

	abstract = {Creating self-learning algorithms, developing deep neural networks and
   improving other methods that ``learn{''} for various areas of human
   activity is the main goal of the theory of machine learning. It helps to
   replace the human with a machine, aiming to increase the quality of
   production. The theory of artificial neural networks, which already have
   replaced the humans in problems of detection of moving objects,
   recognition of images or sounds, time series prediction, big data
   analysis and numerical methods remains the most dispersed branch of the
   theory of machine learning. Certainly, for each area of human activity
   it is necessary to select appropriate neural network architectures,
   methods of data processing and some novel tools from applied
   mathematics. But the universal problem for all these neural networks
   with specific data is the achieving the highest accuracy in short time.
   Such problem can be resolved by increasing sizes of architectures and
   improving data preprocessing, where the accuracy rises with the training
   time. But there is a possibility to increase the accuracy without time
   growing, applying optimization methods. In this survey we demonstrate
   existing optimization algorithms of all types, which can be used in
   neural networks. There are presented modifications of basic optimization
   algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, adaptive moment
   estimation, Newton and quasi-Newton optimization methods. But the most
   recent optimization algorithms are related to information geometry, for
   Fisher-Rao and Bregman metrics. This approach in optimization extended
   the theory of classic neural networks to quantum and complex-valued
   neural networks, due to geometric and probabilistic tools. There are
   provided applications of all introduced optimization algorithms, what
   delighted many kinds of neural networks, which can be improved by
   including any advanced approaches in minimization of the loss function.
   Afterwards, we demonstrated ways of developing optimization algorithms
   in further researches, engaging neural networks with progressive
   architectures. Classical gradient based optimizers can be replaced by
   fractional order, bilevel and, even, gradient free optimization methods.
   There is a possibility to add such analogues in graph, spiking,
   complex-valued, quantum and wavelet neural networks. Besides the usual
   problems of image recognition, time series prediction, object detection,
   there are many are other tasks for modern theory of machine learning,
   such as solving problem of quantum computations, partial differential
   and integro-differential equations, stochastic processes and Brownian
   motion, making decisions and computer algebra.},

	abstract = {Network models are an essential block of modern networks. For example,
   they are widely used in network planning and optimization. However, as
   networks increase in scale and complexity, some models present
   limitations, such as the assumption of Markovian traffic in queuing
   theory models, or the high computational cost of network simulators.
   Recent advances in machine learning, such as Graph Neural Networks
   (GNN), are enabling a new generation of network models that are
   data-driven and can learn complex non-linear behaviors. In this paper,
   we present RouteNet-Fermi, a custom GNN model that shares the same goals
   as Queuing Theory, while being considerably more accurate in the
   presence of realistic traffic models. The proposed model predicts
   accurately the delay, jitter, and packet loss of a network. We have
   tested RouteNet-Fermi in networks of increasing size (up to 300 nodes),
   including samples with mixed traffic profiles - e.g., with complex
   non-Markovian models - and arbitrary routing and queue scheduling
   configurations. Our experimental results show that RouteNet-Fermi
   achieves similar accuracy as computationally-expensive packet-level
   simulators and scales accurately to larger networks. Our model produces
   delay estimates with a mean relative error of 6.24\% when applied to a
   test dataset of 1,000 samples, including network topologies one order of
   magnitude larger than those seen during training. Finally, we have also
   evaluated RouteNet-Fermi with measurements from a physical testbed and
   packet traces from a real-life network.},

	abstract = {Machine learning assisted optimal power flow (OPF) aims to reduce the
   computational complexity of these non-linear and non-convex constrained
   optimization problems by consigning expensive (online) optimization to
   offline training. The majority of work in this area typically employs
   fully connected neural networks (FCNN). However, recently convolutional
   (CNN) and graph (GNN) neural networks have also been investigated, in
   effort to exploit topological information within the power grid.
   Although promising results have been obtained, there lacks a systematic
   comparison between these architectures throughout literature.
   Accordingly, we introduce a concise framework for generalizing methods
   for machine learning assisted OPF and assess the performance of a
   variety of FCNN, CNN and GNN models for two fundamental approaches in
   this domain: regression (predicting optimal generator set-points) and
   classification (predicting the active set of constraints). For several
   synthetic power grids with interconnected utilities, we show that
   locality properties between feature and target variables are scarce and
   subsequently demonstrate marginal utility of applying CNN and GNN
   architectures compared to FCNN for a fixed grid topology. However, with
   variable topology (for instance, modeling transmission line
   contingency), GNN models are able to straightforwardly take the change
   of topological information into account and outperform both FCNN and CNN
   models.},

	abstract = {Deep learning-based approaches have been developed to solve challenging
   problems in wireless communications, leading to promising results. Early
   attempts adopted neural network architectures inherited from
   applications such as computer vision. They often yield poor performance
   in large scale networks (i.e., poor scalability) and unseen network
   settings (i.e., poor generalization). To resolve these issues, graph
   neural networks (GNNs) have been recently adopted, as they can
   effectively exploit the domain knowledge, i.e., the graph topology in
   wireless communications problems. GNN-based methods can achieve
   near-optimal performance in large-scale networks and generalize well
   under different system settings, but the theoretical underpinnings and
   design guidelines remain elusive, which may hinder their practical
   implementations. This paper endeavors to fill both the theoretical and
   practical gaps. For theoretical guarantees, we prove that GNNs achieve
   near-optimal performance in wireless networks with much fewer training
   samples than traditional neural architectures. Specifically, to solve an
   optimization problem on an n-node graph (where the nodes may represent
   users, base stations, or antennas), GNNs' generalization error and
   required number of training samples are O(n) and O(n(2)) times lower
   than the unstructured multi-layer perceptrons. For design guidelines, we
   propose a unified framework that is applicable to general design
   problems in wireless networks, which includes graph modeling, neural
   architecture design, and theory-guided performance enhancement.
   Extensive simulations, which cover a variety of important problems and
   network settings, verify our theory and the effectiveness of the
   proposed design framework.},

	abstract = {Modeling and predicting battery cathode material voltage requires
   accurate structural information regarding the binding sites of lithium
   within a target structure. Obtaining these optimized structures requires
   some form of structural optimization. The ensuing complexity impedes the
   rapid screening of new materials for their suitability in energy
   storage. Previous machine learning (ML) models use structures of both
   lithiated and nonlithiated forms for training; essentially, reproducing
   what is already known, but failing to generalize to structures whose
   lithiated form is not available. To avoid this limitation, an ML model
   capable of predicting the voltage associated with the material's
   lithiation without explicitly requiring the lithiated structure is
   trained. The model's predictive power is improved by adding newly
   calculated data points, with the most impactful being materials with
   unfavorable Li binding, which are lacking in the original dataset. Using
   this model, new cathode candidates among an order of magnitude more
   materials than in previous studies are screened and the most promising
   ones are validated with density functional theory calculations.
   Considering additional stability and conductivity constraints, 572
   materials with voltages greater than 3.5 V are predicted. Unexpectedly,
   some of them are not based on conventional transition metals,
   highlighting the power of an unbiased search.},

	abstract = {Recently, with the development of deep-learning, the performance of
   multiple object tracking (MOT) algorithm based on deep neural networks
   has been greatly improved. However, it is still a difficult problem to
   successfully solve the tracking misalignment caused by occlusion and
   complex tracking scenes. Most of the work focusses on designing a
   sophisticated network, only little work focusses on data association.
   Actually, data association is very helpful in MOT. In this study, data
   association in tracking is taken as the main research task, and the
   authors introduce quadratic graph matching into MOT. Considering the
   objects in each frame as a graph, we can model the data association
   between two frames as a quadratic graph matching problem. And then it is
   transformed into a convex quadratic optimisation problem. Introducing
   high-order structure features into the matching function effectively
   solves some tracking problems. The data association is designed into the
   tracking model as an overall solution. Experiments show that the
   proposed data association algorithm performs favourably against several
   state-of-the-art data association methods and can be used in any
   tracking-by-detection method. Our code is publicly available from .},

	abstract = {In order to balance the performance index and computational efficiency
   of the active suspension control system, this paper offers a fast
   distributed model predictive control (DMPC) method based on multi-agents
   for the active suspension system. Firstly, a seven-degrees-of-freedom
   model of the vehicle is created. This study establishes a
   reduced-dimension vehicle model based on graph theory in accordance with
   its network topology and mutual coupling constraints. Then, for
   engineering applications, a multi-agent-based distributed model
   predictive control method of an active suspension system is presented.
   The partial differential equation of rolling optimization is solved by a
   radical basis function (RBF) neural network. It improves the
   computational efficiency of the algorithm on the premise of satisfying
   multi-objective optimization. Finally, the joint simulation of CarSim
   and Matlab/Simulink shows that the control system can greatly minimize
   the vertical acceleration, pitch acceleration, and roll acceleration of
   the vehicle body. In particular, under the steering condition, it can
   take into account the safety, comfort, and handling stability of the
   vehicle at the same time.},

@article{WOS:000944453000001,
	abstract = {Blockchain has emerged as an innovative technology with potential to
   transform business management, through operational efficiency
   improvements. Nevertheless, several performance and vulnerability issues
   have been identified for the different typologies supporting the wide
   range of blockchain-based applications currently implemented in
   different domains. A variety of analytical and empirical models are
   being used to evaluate the issues associated with the different
   blockchain typologies, enabling systematic analyses of the corresponding
   efficiency impact, and technical or economic threats. A thorough
   systematic literature review of these models has been performed,
   followed by a detailed assessment on the way these models have been
   employed, and the target parameters and applications evaluated (336
   research selected and analysed). We propose a co-classification of these
   models, allowing us to identify which ones are employed to a greater
   extent to address the different blockchain issues in scientific
   research. In a second step, a bibliometric analysis on the selected
   research is conducted, offering a complementary overview of the status
   of and trends in blockchain modelling, including the most prolific
   authors and leading contributing countries to the topic. The main
   outcome and contribution of the paper is the provision of a broad
   overview on how blockchain issues have been analytically tackled,
   through the synthesis and meta-analysis of the models used in the
   scientific literature since the inception of blockchain technology. The
   results have two main direct applications, firstly supporting novel
   vulnerability and performance analyses of existing blockchain
   applications by providing historical information on the models used so
   far, as well as the key parameters and typology of the blockchain-based
   applications evaluated. Secondly, in the implementation of new
   applications, by allowing the recognition of key issues identified that
   are associated with the different blockchain typologies and to determine
   the most suitable models to analyse the weaknesses and risks of the
   alternative designs under evaluation for these new implementations.},

@article{WOS:000918842600001,
	abstract = {Simulations of molecular systems using electronic structure methods are
   still not feasible for many systems of biological importance. As a
   result, empirical methods such as force fields (FF) have become an
   established tool for the simulation of large and complex molecular
   systems. The parametrization of FF is, however, time-consuming and has
   traditionally been based on experimental data. Recent years have
   therefore seen increasing efforts to automatize FF parametrization or to
   replace FF with machine-learning (ML) based potentials. Here, we propose
   an alternative strategy to parametrize FF, which makes use of ML and
   gradient-descent based optimization while retaining a functional form
   founded in physics. Using a predefined functional form is shown to
   enable interpretability, robustness, and efficient simulations of large
   systems over long time scales. To demonstrate the strength of the
   proposed method, a fixed-charge and a polarizable model are trained on
   ab initio potential-energy surfaces. Given only information about the
   constituting elements, the molecular topology, and reference potential
   energies, the models successfully learn to assign atom types and
   corresponding FF parameters from scratch. The resulting models and
   parameters are validated on a wide range of experimentally and
   computationally derived properties of systems including dimers, pure
   liquids, and molecular crystals.},

@article{WOS:000965789900001,
	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is an innovative area of machine learning that
   enables different clients to collaboratively generate a shared model
   while preserving their data privacy. In a typical FL setting, a central
   model is updated by aggregating the clients' parameters of the
   respective artificial neural network. The aggregated parameters are then
   sent back to the clients. However, two main challenges are associated
   with the central aggregation approach. Firstly, most state-of-the-art
   strategies are not optimised to operate in the presence of certain types
   of non-iid (not independent and identically distributed) applications
   and datasets. Secondly, federated learning is vulnerable to various
   privacy and security concerns related to model inversion attacks, which
   can be used to access sensitive information from the training data. To
   address these issues, we propose a novel federated learning strategy
   FedNets based on ensemble learning. Instead of sharing the parameters of
   the clients over the network to update a single global model, our
   approach allows clients to have ensembles of diverse-lightweight models
   and collaborate by sharing ensemble members. FedNets utilises graph
   embedding theory to reduce the complexity of running Deep Neural
   Networks (DNNs) on resource-limited devices. Each Deep Neural Network
   (DNN) is treated as a graph, from which respective graph embeddings are
   generated and clustered to determine which part of the DNN should be
   shared with other clients. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art FL
   algorithms such as Federated Averaging (Fed-Avg) and Adaptive Federated
   Optimisation (Fed-Yogi) in terms of accuracy; on the Federated CIFAR100
   dataset (non-iid), FedNets demonstrates a remarkable 63\% and 92\%
   improvement in accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, FedNets does not
   compromise the client's privacy, as it is safeguarded by the design of
   the method.},

	abstract = {Neural networks are mathematical models that use learning algorithms
   inspired by the brain to store information. These networks have been
   extensively used to operate cognitive functions, robustness, fault
   tolerance, flexibility, collective computation, and ability to deal with
   fuzzy and inconsistent information. In recent years, probabilistic
   neural network (PNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have been
   employed in optimization problems such as input normalization and
   decision making tasks. The flow of data in PNN and CNN will be optimized
   if its peripherality is minimized. Topological index (TI) is a graph
   invariant initially introduced to study physiochemical properties of
   chemical networks. They are further applicable to study certain
   mathematical aspects of a network such as irregularity, centrality and
   peripherality. Recently, the Mostar index and edge Mostar index have
   been introduced to study peripherality of various networks. In the
   current work, Mostar indices for PNN and CNN have been computed and
   their application in context of data flow problem together with
   graphical analysis is presented.},

   graph theory, statistical mechanics, and data science. With the powerful
   tools now available in complex network theory for the study of network
   topology, it is obvious that complex network topology models can be
   applied to enhance artificial neural network models. In this paper, we
   provide an overview of the most important works published within the
   past 10 years on the topic of complex network theory-based optimization
   methods. This review of the most up-to-date optimized neural network
   systems reveals that the fusion of complex and neural networks improves
   both accuracy and robustness. By setting out our review findings here,
   we seek to promote a better understanding of basic concepts and offer a
   deeper insight into the various research efforts that have led to the
   use of complex network theory in the optimized neural networks of today.},

	abstract = {Graph representation learning has now become the de facto standard when
   handling graph-structured data, with the framework of message-passing
   graph neural networks (MPNN) being the most prevailing algorithmic tool.
   Despite its popularity, the family of MPNNs suffers from several
   drawbacks such as transparency and expressivity. Recently, the idea of
   designing neural models on graphs using the theory of graph kernels has
   emerged as a more transparent as well as sometimes more expressive
   alternative to MPNNs known as kernel graph neural networks (KGNNs).
   Developments on KGNNs are currently a nascent field of research, leaving
   several challenges from algorithmic design and adaptation to other
   learning paradigms such as self-supervised learning. In this paper, we
   improve the design and learning of KGNNs. Firstly, we extend the
   algorithmic formulation of KGNNs by allowing a more flexible graph-level
   similarity definition that encompasses former proposals like random walk
   graph kernel, as well as providing a smoother optimization objective
   that alleviates the need of introducing combinatorial learning
   procedures. Secondly, we enhance KGNNs through the lens of
   self-supervision via developing a novel structure-preserving graph data
   augmentation method called latent graph augmentation (LGA). Finally, we
   perform extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the efficacy of
   our proposed mechanisms. Experimental results over benchmark datasets
   suggest that our proposed model achieves competitive performance that is
   comparable to or sometimes outperforming state-of-the-art graph
   representation learning frameworks with or without selfsupervision on
   graph classification tasks. Comparisons against other previously
   established graph data augmentation methods verify that the proposed LGA
   augmentation scheme captures better semantics of graph-level invariance.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, mobile application services face the challenges of high speed,
   low latency and high reliability. The combination of digital twin (DT)
   technology and mobile edge computing (MEC) network can effectively solve
   these challenges. DT technology can help MEC network monitor and predict
   the network states. In this paper, we propose a DT-aided MEC network
   scenario with deep neural network (DNN) inference as the computing task
   of end devices (EDs). ED can offload part of DNN layers to MEC server.
   To allocate communication resources, we propose an algorithm based on
   asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C), which manages the
   transmission power and channel selection of EDs. Since DNN inference is
   continuous in real scenes, we consider the continuous DNN inference
   tasks. We convert the DNN optimal partition point solving problem to a
   min st-cut problem, and propose a graph theory based DNN optimal
   partition point solving algorithm to minimize the inference latency.
   Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively
   reduce the inference latency. Compared with actor-critic (AC) and deep Q
   network (DQN), the proposed algorithm has faster convergence speed and
   better convergence value. Compared with the traditional one-time DNN
   model partition algorithm, the proposed algorithm is more suitable for
   DNN continuous task arrival scenario.},

	abstract = {The discovery of new materials in unexplored chemical spaces
   necessitates quick and accurate prediction of thermodynamic stability,
   often assessed using density functional theory (DFT), and efficient
   search strategies. Here, we develop a new approach to finding stable
   inorganic functional materials. We start by defining an upper bound to
   the fully relaxed energy obtained via DFT as the energy resulting from a
   constrained optimization over only cell volume. Because the fractional
   atomic coordinates for these calculations are known a priori, this upper
   bound energy can be quickly and accurately predicted with a
   scale-invariant graph neural network (GNN). We generate new structures
   via ionic substitution of known prototypes, and train our GNN on a new
   database of 128 000 DFT calculations comprising both fully relaxed and
   volume-only relaxed structures. By minimizing the predicted upper-bound
   energy, we discover new stable structures with over 99\% accuracy
   (versus DFT). We demonstrate the method by finding promising new
   candidates for solid-state battery (SSB) electrolytes that not only
   possess the required stability, but also additional functional
   properties such as large electrochemical stability windows and high
   conduction ion fraction. We expect this proposed framework to be
   directly applicable to a wide range of design challenges in materials
   science.},

	abstract = {We show that separable nonlinear least squares (SNLLS) estimation is
   applicable to all linear structural equation models (SEMs) that can be
   specified in RAM notation. SNLLS is an estimation technique that has
   successfully been applied to a wide range of models, for example neural
   networks and dynamic systems, often leading to improvements in
   convergence and computation time. It is applicable to models of a
   special form, where a subset of parameters enters the objective
   linearly. Recently, Kreiberg et al. (Struct Equ Model Multidiscip J
   28(5):725-739, 2021. ) have shown that this is also the case for factor
   analysis models. We generalize this result to all linear SEMs. To that
   end, we show that undirected effects (variances and covariances) and
   mean parameters enter the objective linearly, and therefore, in the
   least squares estimation of structural equation models, only the
   directed effects have to be obtained iteratively. For model classes
   without unknown directed effects, SNLLS can be used to analytically
   compute least squares estimates. To provide deeper insight into the
   nature of this result, we employ trek rules that link graphical
   representations of structural equation models to their covariance
   parametrization. We further give an efficient expression for the
   gradient, which is crucial to make a fast implementation possible.
   Results from our simulation indicate that SNLLS leads to improved
   convergence rates and a reduced number of iterations.},

@article{WOS:001027956300001,
	abstract = {This paper suggests the Hidden Layer Recurrent Neural Network (HLRNN)
   for controlling a wind power generation system based on a dual-fed
   induction generator. The generator's stator is connected directly to the
   electrical grid, while the rotor is linked through bidirectional
   converters. A PI controller-based Indirect Vector Control (IVC) scheme
   has been established to pilot the system. The PI regulator allows linear
   systems to perform well, but when subjected to physical variation
   conditions, the system's response becomes unstable, making the PI
   controller insufficient. This paper aims to ensure the PI controller
   gains self-adaptation regardless of the severity of the circumstances.
   The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated by taking into
   account critical conditions such as wind speed changes, generator
   parameter variations, and asymmetrical faults in the grid. Furthermore,
   it is confirmed by the enhanced performance and the reduced oscillations
   during a voltage dip. The simulation results, achieved using

	abstract = {Semisupervised learning (SSL) has received a lot of recent attention as
   it alleviates the need for large amounts of labeled data which can often
   be expensive, requires expert knowledge, and be time consuming to
   collect. Recent developments in deep semisupervised classification have
   reached unprecedented performance and the gap between supervised and SSL
   is ever-decreasing. This improvement in performance has been based on
   the inclusion of numerous technical tricks, strong augmentation
   techniques, and costly optimization schemes with multiterm loss
   functions. We propose a new framework, LaplaceNet, for deep
   semisupervised classification that has a greatly reduced model
   complexity. We utilize a hybrid approach where pseudolabels are produced
   by minimizing the Laplacian energy on a graph. These pseudolabels are
   then used to iteratively train a neural-network backbone. Our model
   outperforms state-of-the-art methods for deep semisupervised
   classification, over several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we
   consider the application of strong augmentations to neural networks
   theoretically and justify the use of a multisampling approach for SSL.
   We demonstrate, through rigorous experimentation, that a multisampling
   augmentation approach improves generalization and reduces the
   sensitivity of the network to augmentation.},

   change can be significantly accelerated through the efficient simulation
   of atomistic systems. However, simulation techniques based on first
   principles, such as density functional theory (DFT), are limited in
   their practical use due to their high computational expense. Machine
   learning approaches have the potential to approximate DFT in a
   computationally efficient manner, which could dramatically increase the
   impact of computational simulations on real-world problems. However,
   they are limited by their accuracy and the cost of generating labeled
   data. Here, we present an online active learning framework for
   accelerating the simulation of atomic systems efficiently and accurately
   by incorporating prior physical information learned by large-scale
   pre-trained graph neural network models from the Open Catalyst Project.
   Accelerating these simulations enables useful data to be generated more
   cheaply, allowing better models to be trained and more atomistic systems
   to be screened. We also present a method of comparing local optimization
   techniques on the basis of both their speed and accuracy. Experiments on
   30 benchmark adsorbate-catalyst systems show that our method of transfer
   learning to incorporate prior information from pre-trained models
   accelerates simulations by reducing the number of DFT calculations by
   91\%, while meeting an accuracy threshold of 0.02 eV 93\% of the time.
   Finally, we demonstrate a technique for leveraging the interactive
   functionality built in to Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) to
   efficiently compute single point calculations within our online active
   learning framework without the significant startup costs. This allows
   VASP to work in tandem with our framework while requiring 75\% fewer
   self-consistent cycles than conventional single point calculations. The
   online active learning implementation, and examples using the VASP
   interactive code, are available in the open source FINETUNA package on
   Github.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a comprehensive quantitative and biological neural
   network optimization model of sports industry structure is thoroughly
   studied and analyzed using knowledge graphs. To address the problems of
   poor performance interpretability deficiency of knowledge graph-based
   recommendation methods in the face of relational sparse graphs, a
   pretraining-based implicit characterization algorithm strategy is
   proposed for the recall stage, which can solve the problems of
   difficulty in going online and high delay in the recall stage of the
   recommendation system while improving the accuracy, and not only this
   can be applied in the recall stage, but also the sorting and postsorting
   modules can be used as features. To study the relationship between
   signaling activity and energy metabolism of pyramidal neurons, an
   empirical model of the synaptic vesicle cycle is proposed to simulate
   the synaptic transmission process, the role played by energy metabolism
   in synaptic transmission is studied from the perspective of feedback
   control, and the quantitative relationship between neuronal pulse
   discharge frequency, energy consumption, and information quantity in
   dendritic integration is analyzed using the cable theory and atrial
   chamber model. It was found that, when , the chaotic region shrinks and
   eventually disappears with the increase of the memory factor epsilon;
   however, when 0.6 <= epsilon <= is used, chaos is recreated and the
   chaotic area gradually increases with the increase of the memory factor
   epsilon. This paper conducts comparative experiments on data sets in the
   recommendation domain and verifies that the proposed model and the
   feature intersection module can effectively perform feature interaction
   between items and entities, thus enhancing the recommendation effect.},

	abstract = {In this paper, through data analysis of multimodal knowledge graph
   optimized neural network and visual analysis of college students' sports
   performance, we use huge graph, a graph database supporting distributed
   storage, to store domain knowledge in the form of the knowledge graph,
   use Spring Boot to build a server-side framework, use Vue framework
   combined with vis.js to visualize relational network graphs, and design
   and implement a knowledge-oriented. This paper proposes a visual
   analytics system based on the theory of visual analytics. Based on the
   idea of visual analytics, this paper presents a visual analytics
   framework combining predictive models. This framework combines the
   automated analysis capability of predictive models with interactive
   visualization as a new idea to explore the visual analysis of student
   behavior and performance changes. Using relevant predictive algorithms
   in machine learning, corresponding models are built to refine the
   importance of features for visual analysis and correlate behavioral data
   with achievement data. In this process, multiple prediction algorithms
   are used to build prediction models. The model effects are analyzed and
   compared to select the optimal model for use in the visual analytics
   framework. The graphical analytic view is integrated. EduRedar, an
   optical analytical system for sports data based on the performance
   prediction model, is designed and implemented to support
   multidimensional and multiangle data analysis and visualize the changes
   in college students' sports and performance based on accurate campus
   exercise data.},

	abstract = {The newly appeared g-SGD algorithm can only heuristically find the basis
   path set in a simple neural network, so its generalization to a more
   practical network is hindered. From the perspective of graph theory, the
   BasisPathSetSearching problem is formulated to find the basis path set
   in a complicated fully connected neural network. This paper proposes
   algorithm DEAH to hierarchically solve the BasisPathSetSearching problem
   by eliminating the path dependencies. For this purpose, the authors
   discover the underlying cause of the path dependency between two
   independent substructures. The path subdivision chain is proposed to
   effectively eliminate the path dependency, both inside the chain and
   between chains. The theoretical proofs and the analysis of time
   complexity are presented for Algorithm DEAH. This paper therefore
   provides one methodology to find the basis path set in a general and
   practical neural network.},

	abstract = {Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are a class of NP-hard
   problems with great practical significance. Traditional approaches for
   COPs suffer from high computational time and reliance on expert
   knowledge, and machine learning (ML) methods, as powerful tools have
   been used to overcome these problems. In this review, the COPs in energy
   areas with a series of modern ML approaches, i.e., the interdisciplinary
   areas of COPs, ML and energy areas, are mainly investigated. Recent
   works on solving COPs using ML are sorted out firstly by methods which
   include supervised learning (SL), deep learning (DL), reinforcement
   learning (RL) and recently proposed game theoretic methods, and then
   problems where the timeline of the improvements for some fundamental
   COPs is the layout. Practical applications of ML methods in the energy
   areas, including the petroleum supply chain, steel-making, electric
   power system and wind power, are summarized for the first time, and
   challenges in this field are analyzed.},

   optimization (CV-QAOA), we investigate the utility of
   continuous-variable neural network quantum states (CV-NQS) for
   performing continuous optimization, focusing on the ground state
   optimization of the classical antiferromagnetic rotor model. Numerical
   experiments conducted using variational Monte Carlo with CV-NQS indicate
   that although the non-local algorithm succeeds in finding ground states
   competitive with the local gradient search methods, the proposal suffers
   from unfavorable scaling. A number of proposed extensions are put
   forward which may help alleviate the scaling difficulty.},

	abstract = {Backpropagation of error (backprop) is a powerful algorithm for training
   machine learning architectures through end-to-end differentiation.
   Recently it has been shown that backprop in multilayer perceptrons
   (MLPs) can be approximated using predictive coding, a biologically
   plausible process theory of cortical computation that relies solely on
   local and Hebbian updates. The power of backprop, however, lies not in
   its instantiation in MLPs but in the concept of automatic
   differentiation, which allows for the optimization of any differentiable
   program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we demonstrate that
   predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice, rapidly) to
   exact backprop gradients on arbitrary computation graphs using only
   local learning rules. We apply this result to develop a straightforward
   strategy to translate core machine learning architectures into their
   predictive coding equivalents. We construct predictive coding
   convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and the more
   complex long short-term memory, which include a nonlayer-like branching
   internal graph structure and multiplicative interactions. Our models
   perform equivalently to backprop on challenging machine learning
   benchmarks while using only local and (mostly) Hebbian plasticity. Our
   method raises the potential that standard machine learning algorithms
   could in principle be directly implemented in neural circuitry and may
   also contribute to the development of completely distributed
   neuromorphic architectures.},

	abstract = {Understanding how complex dynamic activity propagates over a static
   structural network is an overarching question in the field of
   neuroscience. Previous work has demonstrated that linear graph-theoretic
   models perform as well as non-linear neural simulations in predicting
   functional connectivity with the added benefits of low dimensionality
   and a closed-form solution which make them far less computationally
   expensive. Here we show a simple model relating the eigenvalues of the
   structural connectivity and functional networks using the Gamma
   function, producing a reliable prediction of functional connectivity
   with a single model parameter. We also investigate the impact of local
   activity diffusion and long-range interhemispheric connectivity on the
   structure-function model and show an improvement in functional
   connectivity prediction when accounting for such latent variables which
   are often excluded from traditional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   methods.},

	abstract = {A vehicle with a four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) has poor
   safety and stability when braking on a low-adhesion road or off-road. In
   view of this situation, this paper proposes a multi-objective
   optimization coordinated control method for ABS and AFS based on
   multi-agent model predictive control (MPC). Firstly, the single-wheel
   control method is adopted to establish the single-wheel equation based
   on the slip rate and the stability equation of the centroid yaw based on
   AFS. The four wheels and the centroid are regarded as agents. The
   mathematical model of distributed drive electric vehicles based on graph
   theory and the coordinated control of AFS and ABS is established to
   reduce the dimension of the model. Secondly, on the basis of the
   multi-agent theory, an integrated coordinated control method for AFS and
   ABS based on distributed model predictive control (DMPC) is proposed to
   realize the ideal values of the vehicle's slip rate, yaw rate, and
   sideslip angle, and improve the braking safety and handling stability of
   the vehicle. Then, to solve the problems of high levels of resource
   consumption, low real-time performance, and complex implementation in
   the optimization of the DMPC solution, a prediction solution method
   using a discrete simplified dual neural network (SDNN) is proposed to
   balance the computational efficiency and system dynamic performance.
   Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test bench is built to test the
   effectiveness of the proposed method under the conditions of a
   low-adhesion road and an off-road.},

	abstract = {As traditional machine learning tools are increasingly applied to
   science and engineering applications, physics-informed methods have
   emerged as effective tools for endowing inferences with properties
   essential for physical realizability. While promising, these methods
   generally enforce physics weakly via penalization. To enforce physics
   strongly, we turn to the exterior calculus framework underpinning
   combinatorial Hodge theory and physics-compatible discretization of
   partial differential equations (PDEs). Historically, these two fields
   have remained largely distinct, as graphs are strictly topological
   objects lacking the metric information fundamental to PDE
   discretization. We present an approach where this missing metric
   information may be learned from data, using graphs as coarse-grained
   mesh surrogates that inherit desirable conservation and exact sequence
   structure from the combinatorial Hodge theory. The resulting data-driven
   exterior calculus (DDEC) may be used to extract structure-preserving
   surrogate models with mathematical guarantees of well-posedness. The
   approach admits a PDE-constrained optimization training strategy which
   guarantees machine-learned models enforce physics to machine precision,
   even for poorly trained models or small data regimes. We provide
   analysis of the method for a class of models designed to reproduce
   nonlinear perturbations of elliptic problems and provide examples of
   learning H(div)/ H(curl) systems representative of subsurface flows and
   electromagnetics. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Infrastructure monitoring is critical for safe operations and
   sustainability. Like many networked systems, water distribution networks
   (WDNs) exhibit both graph topological structure and complex embedded
   flow dynamics. The resulting networked cascade dynamics are difficult to
   predict without extensive sensor data. However, ubiquitous sensor
   monitoring in underground situations is expensive, and a key challenge
   is to infer the contaminant dynamics from partial sparse monitoring
   data. Existing approaches use multi-objective optimization to find the
   minimum set of essential monitoring points but lack performance
   guarantees and a theoretical framework. Here, we first develop a novel
   Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) operator to compress networked
   contamination dynamics to identify the essential principal data
   collection points with inference performance guarantees. As such, the
   GFT approach provides the theoretical sampling bound. We then achieve
   under-sampling performance by building auto-encoder (AE) neural networks
   (NN) to generalize the GFT sampling process and under-sample further
   from the initial sampling set, allowing a very small set of data points
   to largely reconstruct the contamination dynamics over real and
   artificial WDNs. Various sources of the contamination are tested, and we
   obtain high accuracy reconstruction using around 5\%-10\% of the network
   nodes for known contaminant sources, and 50\%-75\% for unknown source
   cases, which although larger than that of the schemes for contaminant
   detection and source identifications, is smaller than the current
   sampling schemes for contaminant data recovery. This general approach of
   compression and under-sampled recovery via NN can be applied to a wide
   range of networked infrastructures to enable efficient data sampling for
   digital twins.},

	abstract = {Inspired by macroeconomic scenarios, we aim to experimentally
   investigate the evolution of short- and long-run expectations under
   different specifications of the fundamentals. We collect individual
   predictions for future prices in a series of Learning to Forecast
   Experiments with a time-varying fundamental value. In particular, we
   observe how expectations evolve in markets where the fundamental value
   follows either a V-shaped or an inverse V-shaped pattern. These
   conditions are compared with markets characterized by a constant and a
   slightly linear increasing fundamental value. We assess whether minor
   but systematic variations in the fundamentals affect individual short-
   and long-run expectations by considering positive and negative
   feedback-expectation systems. Compared to a setting with constant
   fundamentals, the slowly varying fundamentals have a limited impact on
   how subjects form their expectations in positive feedback markets,
   whereas in negative feedback markets we observe notable changes.},

	abstract = {Efforts across diverse domains like economics, energy, and agronomy have
   focused on developing predictive models for time series data. A spectrum
   of techniques, spanning from elementary linear models to intricate
   neural networks and machine learning algorithms, has been explored to
   achieve accurate forecasts. The hybrid ARIMA-SVR model has garnered
   attention due to its fusion of a foundational linear model with error
   correction capabilities. However, its use is limited to stationary time
   series data, posing a significant challenge. To overcome these
   limitations and drive progress, we propose the innovative NAR-SVR hybrid
   method. Unlike its predecessor, this approach breaks free from
   stationarity and linearity constraints, leading to improved model
   performance solely through historical data exploitation. This
   advancement significantly reduces the time and computational resources
   needed for precise predictions, a critical factor in univariate economic
   time series forecasting. We apply the NAR-SVR hybrid model in three
   scenarios: Spanish berry daily yield data from 2018 to 2021, daily
   COVID-19 cases in three countries during 2020, and the daily Bitcoin
   price time series from 2015 to 2020. Through extensive comparative
   analyses with other time series prediction models, our results
   substantiate that our novel approach consistently outperforms its
   counterparts. By transcending stationarity and linearity limitations,
   our hybrid methodology establishes a new paradigm for univariate time
   series forecasting, revolutionizing the field and enhancing predictive
   capabilities across various domains as highlighted in this study.},

	abstract = {Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are mathematical models that
   are widely used to describe com-plex processes or phenomena perturbed by
   random noise from different sources. The identification of SDEs
   governing a system is often a challenge because of the inherent strong
   stochasticity of data and the complexity of the system's dynamics. The
   practical utility of existing parametric approaches for iden-tifying
   SDEs is usually limited by insufficient data resources. This study
   presents a novel framework for identifying SDEs by leveraging the sparse
   Bayesian learning (SBL) technique to search for a parsimonious, yet
   physically necessary representation from the space of candidate basis
   functions. More importantly, we use the analytical tractability of SBL
   to develop an efficient way to formulate the linear regression problem
   for the discovery of SDEs that requires considerably less time-series
   data. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using
   real data on stock and oil prices, bearing variation, and wind speed, as
   well as simulated data on well-known stochastic dynamical systems,
   including the gen-eralized Wiener process and Langevin equation. This
   framework aims to assist specialists in extracting stochastic
   mathematical models from random phenomena in the natural sciences,
   economics, and engi-neering fields for analysis, prediction, and
   decision making.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier LTD on

	abstract = {The advancements of the Internet of Things (IoT) and voice-based
   multimedia applications have resulted in the generation of big data
   consisting of patterns, trends and associations capturing and
   representing many features of human behaviour. The latent
   representations of many aspects and the basis of human behaviour is
   naturally embedded within the expression of emotions found in human
   speech. This signifies the importance of mining audio data collected
   from human conversations for extracting human emotion. Ability to
   capture and represent human emotions will be an important feature in
   next-generation artificial intelligence, with the expectation of closer
   interaction with humans. Although the textual representations of human
   conversations have shown promising results for the extraction of
   emotions, the acoustic feature-based emotion detection from audio still
   lags behind in terms of accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach
   for feature extraction consisting of Bag-of-Audio-Words (BoAW) based
   feature embeddings for conversational audio data. A Recurrent Neural
   Network (RNN) based state-of-the-art emotion detection model is proposed
   that captures the conversation-context and individual party states when
   making real-time categorical emotion predictions. The performance of the
   proposed approach and the model is evaluated using two benchmark
   datasets along with an empirical evaluation on real-time prediction
   capability. The proposed approach reported 60.87\% weighted accuracy and
   60.97\% unweighted accuracy for six basic emotions for IEMOCAP dataset,
   significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art models.},

	abstract = {As a case study for our research, COVID-19, that was caused by a unique
   coronavirus, has substantially affected the globe, not only in terms of
   healthcare, but also in terms of economics, education, transportation,
   and politics. Predicting the pandemic's course is critical to combating
   and tracking its spread. The objective of our study is to evaluate,
   optimize and fine-tune state of the art prediction models in order to
   enhance its performance and to automate its function as possible.
   Therefore, a comparison between statistical versus compartmental methods
   for time series-based modeling and forecasting of infectious disease
   progression was conducted. The comparison included several classical
   univariate time series statistical models, including Exponential
   Smoothing, Holt, Holt-Winters, and Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated
   Moving Average (SARIMA), as opposed to an optimized version of the
   compartmental multivariate epidemiological model SEIRD, which is
   referred to in our study, as, Non-Linear L-BFGS-B Fitted SEIRD. The
   mentioned methods were implemented and fine-tuned to model and forecast
   COVID-19 outbreak situation represented by confirmed cases, recoveries,
   and fatalities in (Australia, Canada, Egypt, India, United States of
   America and United Kingdom). Through the implementing and tuning of both
   types of models, we have observed that while univariate time series
   forecasting models such as SARIMA produce highly accurate predictions
   due to their ease of use and procedure, as well as their ability to deal
   with seasonality and cycles in time series, multivariate epidemiological
   models are more powerful and extendible. Despite their complexity,
   epidemiological models have aided extensively in understanding the
   spread and severity of infectious disease pandemics such as the COVID-19
   global pandemic. Using our optimized SEIRD, we have obtained a Mean
   Squared Log Error of 10(-3) order, demonstrating the forecasts' elevated
   accuracy and reliability. In addition to forecasting the course of the
   pandemic for a 3 months season in all countries under investigation, we
   were able to estimate the transmission potential of COVID-19 represented
   by its effective reproduction number R-t. With R-t=1 is considered as
   the pandemic control threshold, it is evident that all of the countries
   under investigation are hovering just above the control threshold. This
   study might be relieving since it can demonstrate that the world is on
   the right track in terms of putting an end to the pandemic as soon as
   possible. The whole study shows how powerful is compartmental methods
   compared to classical statistical methods when used to model and
   forecast an infectious disease outbreak which encourages our further
   related research concerning the study of implementing advanced
   compartmental models considering additional parameters and controls.},

	abstract = {State-space models (SSMs) have been widely used for analyzing
   time-series data in the fields of economics and bioinformatics to
   express the dynamic behavior of data. Recently, filtering and smoothing
   algorithms applied to linear discrete SSMs with skewed and heavy-tailed
   measurement noise have been proposed for a more appropriate model
   because mea-surement noise does not often follow a Gaussian
   distribution. In this paper, we propose a linear SSM with skew-t
   measurement noise for predicting blood test values, along with a method
   for estimating their parameter values to ensure consistency with the
   data when using a generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
   To validate the effective-ness of the proposed model and method, we
   analyze time-series blood test data using both Gaussian and skew-t
   measurement noise and compared their prediction accuracy for future
   values. Then, we predicted future blood test values of the unhealthy
   participant under his current and improved lifestyles. By comparing
   these predicted results under dif-ferent lifestyles, we demonstrate that
   he will overcome lifestyle-related diseases with the improved lifestyle.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to
   improve the automatic recognition of dysarthric speech through the use
   of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory
   (LSTM) neural networks. Dysarthria is one of the most common speech
   communication disorders associated with neurological impairments that
   can drastically reduce the intelligibility of speech. The aim of the
   present study is twofold. First, it compares three different input
   features for training and testing dysarthric speech recognition systems.
   These features are the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs),
   mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs), and the perceptual linear
   prediction features (PLPs). Second, the performance of the CNN- and
   LSTM-based architectures is compared against a state-of-the-art baseline
   system based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Gaussian mixture models
   (GMMs) to determine the best dysarthric speech recognizer. Experimental
   results show that the CNN-based system using perceptual linear
   prediction features provides a recognition rate that can reach 82\%,
   which constitutes relative improvement of 11\% and 32\% when compared to
   the performance of LSTM- and GMM-HMM-based systems, respectively.},

	abstract = {An analysis was made of two prediction methods: the Linear Approximation
   Method (LAM) and Brown's Exponential Smoothing Model (BESM). These two
   methods were investigated and compared in terms of their efficiency in
   timber price prediction. Models and price predictions were prepared
   based on three time series (5-, 7- and 9-year) for three years: 2015,
   2016 and 2017. The analyses were conducted using data on mean annual
   timber prices from the period 2006-2017. This meant that the time series
   included the years of the 2007-2008 economic crisis. Prediction
   efficiency was evaluated by comparing the results obtained with actual
   timber prices in the years 2015-2017. It was found that the predictions
   generated by LAM were better than those produced by BESM. The smallest
   relative and absolute errors of prediction were obtained applying the
   linear function: y(t)<\^{}> = 5.277t + 161.70. This function was
   constructed based on a 5-year time series. Absolute error amounted to
   1.59 PLN ((SIC)0.35). Relative error was below 1\%. The results of this
   work suggest that further studies are desirable to investigate the
   applicability of trend analysis to the prediction of timber prices with
   the inclusion of analyses of nonlinear trends. The present results of
   timber price modelling may provide a basis to search for a homogeneous
   model of timber price prediction adapted to specific conditions of
   timber sales.},

	abstract = {Forecasting of rainfall is important to be prepared for future
   weather-related disasters. Rainfall data can be categorized as time
   series data because rainfall data can be recorded in chronological
   order. Time series forecast is used in fields like economics,
   environmental, and engineering predictions as a decision support factor.
   Due to the importance, many models and methodologies have been developed
   for time series forecasts according to the types of inputs, expected
   outcomes, and easy applicability. This research was conducted to
   identify the most appropriate time series forecast model for rainfall
   prediction. A regression type model and a neural network model were
   selected to identify which type of forecast model is more suitable for
   rainfall prediction. ARIMA model and Recurrent Neural Network model of
   Non-linear Auto-Regressive Moving Average were selected as the candidate
   prediction models for time series forecast and the models were developed
   for rainfall forecast. From the developed models, it was observed that
   the RNN models are suitable for long-term prediction of rainfall and
   drought with the availability of a higher number of past rainfall data
   while the ARIMA model is more suitable for prediction of rainfall where
   there is less past recorded rainfall data for a short-term forecast
   period.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the variable selection problem in the context of
   Linear Regression for large databases. The problem consists of selecting
   a small subset of independent variables that can perform the prediction
   task optimally. This problem has a wide range of applications. One
   important type of application is the design of composite indicators in
   various areas (sociology and economics, for example). Other important
   applications of variable selection in linear regression can be found in
   fields such as chemometrics, genetics, and climate prediction, among
   many others. For this problem, we propose a Branch \& Bound method. This
   is an exact method and therefore guarantees optimal solutions. We also
   provide strategies that enable this method to be applied in very large
   databases (with hundreds of thousands of cases) in a moderate
   computation time. A series of computational experiments shows that our
   method performs well compared to well-known methods in the literature
   and with commercial software.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a powerful system for communicating
   between the brain and outside world. Traditional BCI systems work based
   on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals only. Recently, researchers have
   used a combination of EEG signals with other signals to improve the
   performance of BCI systems. Among these signals, the combination of EEG
   with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has achieved
   favourable results. In most studies, only EEGs or fNIRs have been
   considered as chain-like sequences, and do not consider complex
   correlations between adjacent signals, neither in time nor channel
   location. In this study, a deep neural network model has been introduced
   to identify the exact objectives of the human brain by introducing
   temporal and spatial features. The proposed model incorporates the
   spatial relationship between EEG and fNIRS signals. This could be
   implemented by transforming the sequences of these chain-like signals
   into hierarchical three-rank tensors. The tests show that the proposed
   model has a precision of 99.6\%.},

	abstract = {The article analyzes the possibility of adopting trend estimation model
   to predict the average selling price of timber (CGUS). The study used
   information about the average selling prices of timber in chosen periods
   (2006-2017). The data concerning the actual CGUS was used to create a
   trend estimation model. The models and CGUS predictions were conducted
   based on three different time series encompassing 5-year periods. The
   predicted (CGUS) trend estimation in particular years was requested
   based on extrapolation, which exceeded the accepted set of information
   used in the study to create a trend estimation model. On the basis of
   the conducted study it was ascertained that the method of modeling
   linear trend estimation should be adopted in the price prediction
   process. The error assessment with which the linear function formulas
   are burdened, it was noticed that the value of the coefficient of
   residual variation was between 4.40\% and 7.82\%. It was also noticed
   that the linear modeling of CGUS trend estimation, despite unfavorable
   values of coefficient of determination and convergence, to some extent,
   can be viewed as an assistance tool in the decision-making process in
   the scope of predicting the height of the analyzed price. This view was
   supported by the achieved predictions which were verified with the
   actual prices of timber. The price difference between the actual and the
   predicted one was between -1.59 PLN to 2.27 PLN, and in relative terms
   the predictive error was between 0.83 to 1.15\%. In our opinion the
   presented research process can constitute a reference point as a
   comparative element to verify the the results for other, new price
   prediction models. The process of modeling timber prices should be
   extended by other predicators which are connected with forest market
   chain.},

	abstract = {Forecasting of fast fluctuated and high-frequency financial data is
   always a challenging problem in the field of economics and modelling. In
   this study, a novel hybrid model with the strength of fractional order
   derivative is presented with their dynamical features of deep learning,
   long-short term memory (LSTM) networks, to predict the abrupt stochastic
   variation of the financial market. Stock market prices are dynamic,
   highly sensitive, nonlinear and chaotic. There are different techniques
   for forecast prices in the time-variant domain and due to variability
   and uncertain behavior in stock prices, traditional methods, such as
   data mining, statistical approaches, and non-deep neural networks models
   are not suited for prediction and generalized forecasting stock prices.
   While autoregressive fractional integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model
   provides a flexible tool for classes of long-memory models. The
   advancement of machine learning-based deep non-linear modelling confirms
   that the hybrid model efficiently extracts profound features and model
   non-linear functions. LSTM networks are a special kind of recurrent
   neural network (RNN) that map sequences of input observations to output
   observations with capabilities of long-term dependencies. A novel
   ARFIMA-LSTM hybrid recurrent network is presented in which ARFIMA
   model-based filters having the linear tendencies better than ARIMA model
   in the data and passes the residual to the LSTM model that captures
   nonlinearity in the residual values with the help of exogenous dependent
   variables. The model not only minimizes the volatility problem but also
   overcome the over fitting problem of neural networks. The model is
   evaluated using PSX company data of the stock market based on RMSE, MSE
   and MAPE along with a comparison of ARIMA, LSTM model and generalized
   regression radial basis neural network (GRNN) ensemble method
   independently. The forecasting performance indicates the effectiveness
   of the proposed AFRIMA-LSTM hybrid model to improve around 80\% accuracy
   on RMSE as compared to traditional forecasting counterparts.},

	abstract = {In this paper the classification of motor imagery brain signals is
   addressed. The innovative idea is to use both temporal and spatial
   knowledge of the input data to increase the performance. Definitely, the
   electrode locations on the scalp is as important as the acquired
   temporal signals from every individual electrode. In order to
   incorporate this knowledge, a deep neural network is employed in this
   work. Both motor-imagery EEG and bi-modal EEG-fNIRS datasets were used
   for this purpose. The results are compared for different scenarios and
   using different methods. The achieved results are promising and imply
   that combining both temporal and spatial information of the brain
   signals could be really effective and increases the performance.},

	abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are more suitable for learning
   non-linear dependencies in dynamical systems from observed time series
   data. In practice, all the external variables driving such systems are
   not known a priori, especially in economical forecasting. A class of
   RNNs called Error Correction Neural Networks (ECNNs) was designed to
   compensate for missing input variables. It does this by feeding back in
   the current step the error made in the previous step. The ECNN is
   implemented in Python by the computation of the appropriate gradients
   and it is tested on stock market predictions. As expected it
   outperformed the simple RNN and LSTM and other hybrid models which
   involve a de-noising pre-processing step. The intuition for the latter
   is that de-noising may lead to loss of information.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Bitcoin has become the most popular cryptocurrency, which
   gains the attention of investors and speculators alike. Asset pricing is
   a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders.
   Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the
   multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the
   market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem
   provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While
   there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based
   on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze
   the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we
   investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore
   statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price.
   In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted
   from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the
   sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market
   stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series
   predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with
   eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We
   demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions,
   with a mean squared error lower than 0.14\%, due to the inclusion of the
   studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better
   predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model,
   we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario.},

	abstract = {The problem of optimal linear filtering, smoothing and trend extraction
   for m-period differences of processes with a unit root is studied. Such
   processes arise naturally in economics and finance, in the form of rates
   of change (price inflation, economic growth, financial returns) and
   finding an appropriate smoother is thus of immediate practical interest.
   The filter and resulting smoother are based on the methodology of
   singular spectrum analysis (SSA). An explicit representation for the
   asymptotic decomposition of the covariance matrix is obtained. The
   structure of the impulse and frequency response functions indicates that
   the optimal filter has a `permanent' and a `transitory component', with
   the corresponding smoother being the sum of two such components.
   Moreover, a particular form for the extrapolation coefficients that can
   be used in out-of-sample prediction is proposed. In addition, an
   explicit representation for the filtering weights in the context of SSA
   for an arbitrary covariance matrix is derived. This result allows one to
   examine the specific effects of smoothing in any situation. The
   theoretical results are illustrated using different datasets, namely US
   inflation and real GDP growth.},

	abstract = {Trend change prediction in complex systems with a large number of noisy
   time series is a problem with many applications for real-world
   phenomena, with stock markets as a notoriously difficult to predict
   example of such systems. We approach predictions of directional trend
   changes via complex lagged correlations between them, excluding any
   information about the target series from the respective inputs to
   achieve predictions purely based on such correlations with other series.
   We propose the use of deep neural networks that employ step-wise linear
   regressions with exponential smoothing in the preparatory feature
   engineering for this task, with regression slopes as trend strength
   indicators for a given time interval. We apply this method to historical
   stock market data from 2011 to 2016 as a use case example of lagged
   correlations between large numbers of time series that are heavily
   influenced by externally arising new information as a random factor. The
   results demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach, with
   state-of-the-art accuracies and accounting for the statistical
   significance of the results for additional validation, as well as
   important implications for modern financial economics. (C) 2018 Elsevier

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach for proactive edge caching in
   wireless small cell networks. Specifically, we propose using a recurrent
   neural network for predicting the content popularity with low
   computational complexity. The mean estimation error of the adopted
   recurrent neural network could be very close to that of the optimal
   linear prediction filter utilizing all past history. Based on the
   predicted content popularity, we formulate and solve a minimum cost flow
   problem in order to optimally place content files at edge caches. Since
   the computational complexity of the adopted recurrent neural network is
   relatively low and the minimum cost flow problem can be solved in
   polynomial time, the proposed approach is feasible in practice.
   Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms a greedy
   approach and can significantly reduce the bandwidth consumption of the
   backhaul network.},

	abstract = {Neural speech synthesis models have recently demonstrated the ability to
   synthesize high quality speech for text-to-speech and compression
   applications. These new models often require powerful GPUs to achieve
   real-time operation, so being able to reduce their complexity would open
   the way for many new applications. We propose LPCNet, a WaveRNN variant
   that combines linear prediction with recurrent neural networks to
   significantly improve the efficiency of speech synthesis. We demonstrate
   that LPCNet can achieve significantly higher quality than WaveRNN for
   the same network size and that high quality LPCNet speech synthesis is
   achievable with a complexity under 3 GFLOPS. This makes it easier to
   deploy neural synthesis applications on lower-power devices, such as
   embedded systems and mobile phones.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have become the compelling solution for the
   applications such as image classification, object detection, speech
   recognition, and machine translation. However, the great success comes
   at the cost of excessive computation due to the over-provisioned
   parameter space. To improve the computation efficiency of neural
   networks, many pruning techniques have been proposed to reduce the
   amount of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which results in high
   sparsity in the networks.
   Unfortunately, the sparse neural networks often run slower than their
   dense counterparts on modern GPUs due to their poor device utilization
   rate. In particular, as the sophisticated hardware primitives (e.g.,
   Tensor Core) have been deployed to boost the performance of dense matrix
   multiplication by an order of magnitude, the performance of sparse
   neural networks lags behind significantly.
   In this work, we propose an algorithm and hardware co-design methodology
   to accelerate the sparse neural networks. A novel pruning algorithm is
   devised to improve the workload balance and reduce the decoding overhead
   of the sparse neural networks. Meanwhile, new instructions and
   micro-architecture optimization are proposed in Tensor Core to adapt to
   the structurally sparse neural networks. Our experimental results show
   that the pruning algorithm can achieve 63\% performance gain with model
   accuracy sustained. Furthermore, the hardware optimization gives an
   additional 58\% performance gain with negligible area overhead.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of estimating the parameters of
   adaptive directional time-frequency distributions (ADTFDs). ADTFDs
   locally optimize the direction of the smoothing kernel on the basis of
   directional Gaussian or double derivative directional Gaussian filter.
   Conventionally, the parameters of these techniques have to be tuned
   manually for each particular signal. Global optimization of the
   parameters fails to provide the desired results when the signal
   encompasses close or short-duration components. We propose a two-stage
   algorithm to resolve this issue. As part of the first stage, the length
   of the smoothing kernel is optimized globally. In the second stage, the
   parameters which control the shape of the selected smoothing window are
   optimized, locally. It is shown that the multistage algorithm can result
   in a time-frequency distribution that has both high resolution for close
   components and good concentration of signal energy for short-duration
   signal components. Experimental findings reveal the superiority of the
   proposed technique over the existing methods in the case of complete
   signals and its benefits in the case of signals with missing samples.},

	abstract = {In this paper, power suppression detection in mu band known as
   event-related desynchronization during a simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording
   is addressed. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments provide great
   opportunities to recognize relation between the active areas in the
   brain, discovered by fMRI, and EEG events. However, decoding EEG is
   challenging as a result of artifacts which MRI scanner applies on EEG.
   Ballistocardiogram (BCG) is one of the main destructive artifacts which
   deteriorates EEG rhythms specially in mu band. The proposed method, is a
   supervised time-frequency decomposition algorithm which estimates
   underlying rhythms of EEG signals recorded in MRI scanner. In the
   proposed method, a multi layer decomposition approach using three
   criteria is developed to extract brain oscillations. This goal is
   achieved by eliminating the artifact related components at each
   decomposition layer as a result of removing useless extracted components
   in each layer. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated using
   synthetic and real EEG. The achieved results from synthetic data confirm
   the ability of the proposed method to extract mu rhythms when different
   levels of noise exist. In addition, proposed algorithm is applied on a
   set of real EEG acquired in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording. Estimated
   ERD confirms the superiority of the developed algorithm in terms of
   estimating changes of mu rhythms. Moreover, an EEG-fMRI integration is
   performed to explore the correlation between blood oxygenation level
   dependent (BOLD) in fMRI and ERD of mu rhythm in EEG. (C) 2017 Elsevier

	abstract = {Bitcoin has recently attracted considerable attention in the fields of
   economics, cryptography, and computer science due to its inherent nature
   of combining encryption technology and monetary units. This paper
   reveals the effect of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) by analyzing the
   time series of Bitcoin process. We also select the most relevant
   features from Blockchain information that is deeply involved in
   Bitcoin's supply and demand and use them to train models to improve the
   predictive performance of the latest Bitcoin pricing process. We conduct
   the empirical study that compares the Bayesian neural network with other
   linear and non-linear benchmark models on modeling and predicting the
   Bitcoin process. Our empirical studies show that BNN performs well in
   predicting Bitcoin price time series and explaining the high volatility
   of the recent Bitcoin price.},

	abstract = {Noise-affected economic time series, realizations of stochastic
   processes exhibiting complex and possibly nonlinear dynamics, are dealt
   with. This is often the case of time series found in economics, which
   notoriously suffer from problems such as low signal-to-noise ratios,
   asymmetric cycles and multiregimes patterns. In such a framework, even
   sophisticated statistical models might generate suboptimal predictions,
   whose quality can further deteriorate unless time consuming updating or
   deeper model revision procedures are carried out on a regular basis.
   However, when the models' outcomes are expected to be disseminated in
   timeliness manner (as in the case of Central Banks or national
   statistical offices), their modification might not be a viable solution,
   due to time constraints. On the other hand, if the application of
   simpler linear models usually entails relatively easier tuning-up
   procedures, this would come at the expenses of the quality of the
   predictions yielded. A mixed, self-tuning forecasting method is
   therefore proposed. This is an automatic, 2-stage procedure, able to
   generate predictions by exploiting the denoising capabilities provided
   by the wavelet theory in conjunction with a compounded forecasting
   generator. Its out-of-sample performances are evaluated through an
   empirical study carried out on macroeconomic time series.},

	abstract = {Soccer match attendance is an example of group behavior with noisy
   context that can only be approximated by a limited set of quantifiable
   factors. However, match attendance is representative of a wider spectrum
   of context-based behaviors for which only the aggregate effect of
   otherwise individual decisions is observable. Modeling of such behaviors
   is desirable from the perspective of economics, psychology, and other
   social studies with prospective use in simulators, games, product
   planning, and advertising. In this paper, we evaluate the efficiency of
   different neural network architectures as models of context in
   attendance behavior by comparing the achieved prediction accuracy of a
   multilayer perceptron (MLP), an Elman recurrent neural network (RNN), a
   time-lagged feedforward neural network (TLFN), and a radial basis
   function network (RBFN) against a multiple linear regression model, an
   autoregressive moving average model with exogenous inputs, and a naive
   cumulative mean model. We show that the MLP, TLFN, and RNN are superior
   to the RBFN and achieve comparable prediction accuracy on datasets of
   three teams from the English Football League Championship, which
   indicates weak importance of context transition modeled by the TLFN and
   the RNN. The experiments demonstrate that all neural network models
   outperform linear predictors by a significant margin. We show that
   neural models built on individual datasets achieve better performance
   than a generalized neural model constructed from pooled data. We analyze
   the input parameter influences extracted from trained networks and show
   that there is an agreement between nonlinear and linear measures about
   the most significant attributes.},

	abstract = {Purpose - Tourism is a growing sector, playing an important role in many
   economies, always looking for methods to provide tourism demand
   forecasting and new creative ideas to develop local tourist offer.
   Early prediction on the tourist inflow represents a challenge helping
   local economy to optimize and develop tourist income. Forecasting models
   for international tourism demand have usually mainly been focused on
   factors affecting the tourist inflow, following an approach that is
   time-consuming and expensive in developing econometric models.
   Design - We modelled a backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (a
   Machine Learning Method for Decision Support and Pattern Discovery) to
   forecast tourists arrivals in Croatia and compared the results with
   those obtained with the linear regression methods.
   Methodology - The accuracy of the neural network has been measured by
   the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and compared to MSE and R-2 obtained with
   the linear regression.
   Approach - Our approach consists in combining ideas from Tourism
   Economics and Information Technology, in particular Machine Learning,
   with the aim of presenting creative applications of algorithms, such as
   the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to the tourism sector.
   Findings - The results showed that using the neural network model to
   predict tourists arrivals outperforms linear regression techniques.
   Originality of the research -The idea to use ANN as a Decision Making
   tool to improve tourist services in a proactive way or in case of
   unexpected events is innovative. Moreover, in our final consideration,
   we will also present other possible creative improvements of the method.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to develop the system of speaker
   identification. Speaker identification is a technology that allows a
   computer to automatically identify the person who is speaking, based on
   the information received from speech signal. One of the most difficult
   problems in speaker recognition is dealing with noises. The performance
   of speaker recognition using close speaking microphone (CSM) is affected
   in background noises. To overcome this problem throat microphone (TM)
   which has a transducer held at the throat resulting in a clean signal
   and unaffected by background noises is used. Acoustic features namely
   linear prediction coefficients, linear prediction cepstral coefficients,
   Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and relative spectral
   transform-perceptual linear prediction are extracted. These features are
   classified using RBFNN and AANN and their performance is analyzed. A new
   method was proposed for identification of speakers in clean and noisy
   using combined CSM and TM. The identification performance of the
   combined system is increased than individual system due to complementary

   Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCC) in combination with two
   different Neural Network models such as Radial Basis Neural Networks and
   Learning Vector Quantization Neural Networks have been experimented.
   Three different test categories such as Spoken word recognition, Speaker
   Identification, and the combination of both speaker and spoken word
   recognition have been experimented for the above mentioned combinations.
   It is Suggested from the experiments that the combination of GFCC and

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel technique based on blind source extraction (BSE)
   using linear prediction is proposed to extract rolandic beta rhythm from
   electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI
   experiment. We call this method CLP-BSE standing for
   constrained-linear-prediction BSE. Extracting event-related oscillations
   is a crucial task due to nonphase-locked nature and inter-trial
   variability of this event. The main objective of this work is to extract
   rolandic beta rhythm to measure event-related synchronization (ERS) with
   acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The extracted rhythm is utilized
   for constructing a regressor to analyze functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). The proposed method is a semi-blind technique which uses
   a spatio-temporal constraint for beta rhythm extraction. This constraint
   is derived from recorded EEG signals based on the prior knowledge about
   the frequency and location of the source of interest. The main reason of
   employing linear prediction as an effective algorithm to extract the EEG
   rhythm is the ability of extracting sources which have specific temporal
   structure. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated using both
   synthetic and real EEG data. The obtained results show that the proposed
   technique is able to extract ERS effectively. The maximum percentage of
   ERS obtained by filtering is 152\% while the obtained ERS by CLP-BSE is
   214\%. In another experiment, the extracted event-related oscillations
   in beta band are used to make the necessary regressor for fMRI analysis.
   The results of EEG-fMRI coregistration confirm that there are
   correlation between the extracted rolandic beta rhythm and
   simultaneously recorded fMRI. This conclude that, the results of
   EEG-fMRI combination support the reliability of CLP-BSE output.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based algorithm
   design to identify speakers of specific dialect using features obtained
   from various speaker dependent parameters of voiced speech. It is
   evident that speakers can be identified from their voiced sounds which
   have higher energy. Voice sounds are extracted from continuous speech
   signal from a set of trained male and female speakers. Here, feature
   vectors are generated from the speaker specific characteristics like
   pitch, linear prediction (LP) residual and empirical mode decomposition
   (EMD) residual of the speech. Using these feature vectors, three
   different ANN classifiers are designed using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
   and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to identify the speakers along with
   the dialect of the speaker. From the experiment, it is found that a
   hybrid classifier designed by combining all three classifiers correctly
   identifies more than 90\% of the enrolled speakers.},
